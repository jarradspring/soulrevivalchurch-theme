They partner with us in two important ways: by praying for Soul Revival and by giving to Soul Revival, or both. They can also sign up to receive regular news, stories, videos and paryer updates from Soul Revival.</p>

        <p>Soul Revival Church is an exciting new Anglican ministry in the Sutherland Shire. We are a group of people who seek to love God, each other and our City. We are committed to sharing the love of Jesus person to person, generation to generation with people who donâ€™t go to church. As surprising as it may seem, only about 1% of people in the Sutherland Shire attend Anglican Churches. Under God, we hope to reach more people in new ways.</p>
        <p>At Soul Revival we believe that the Bible is the word of God, we believe that Jesus saves us through his death on the cross and his subsequent resurrection and that trusting in Him is the only way to get to heaven</p>
        <h3>We Are Different</h3>
